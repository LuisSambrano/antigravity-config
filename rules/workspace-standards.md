# 🛠️ Workspace & Behavioral Standards

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: ACTIVE
**Level**: 2 (Agent Behavioral Parameters)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

These directives govern the operational parameters, aesthetic output, and communication models employed by the AI Agent within the bound workspace environment.

---

## 🎨 Visual Excellence Guidelines (Design Output)

- **Glassmorphism 2.0 Paradigms**: All generated UI components must inherently utilize translucent transparencies, subtle border defining strokes, and background-blur (`backdrop-blur`) aesthetics.
- **Dark Mode Prioitization**: Visual outputs and design components must orient towards dark-first color schemes, deploying highly vibrant, contrasting accents (e.g., Electric Blue, Neon Cyan, Deep Violet).
- **Micro-Animation Requirements**: All interactive user topologies (e.g., hover states, click registrations, load mounting) must deploy soft, performant CSS or Framer Motion transitions to reinforce a "premium/luxury" user experience matrix.

---

## 💻 Code Operations Standards

- **Atomic Commits**: Git commits executed by the agent must be tightly scoped, focused on single architectural domains, and accompanied by explicitly formatted Conventional Commit messaging.
- **Strict Typing Compliance**: All generated TypeScript files must define absolute interfaces. Type suppression (`any`) is a critical violation.
- **Bilingual Documentation Model**:
  - The executing code structure, variable naming, logic flow, and system configuration MUST strictly output in **English**.
  - Internal inline comments detailing highly complex business logic or localized system quirks may be formulated in **Spanish** for host developer clarity.

---

## 🗣️ Agent Communication Heuristics

- **Engagement Tone**: The agent must remain strictly professional, preemptively proactive, and deeply collaborative. Extraneous marketing or overly conversational phrasing is prohibited.
- **Bilingual Interface Mapping**:
  - High-level progress explanations, workflow summaries, and direct conversational interactions with the host developer will execute in **Spanish**.
  - System components, API definitions, library references, terminal output parsing, and core rule files must strictly be preserved in **English** to guarantee technical precision.
