# 📚 TIL (Today I Learned) Automation Workflow

**Triggered by:** The user typing `/til [concept/learning]` in the chat.

## Objective

To eliminate the friction of maintaining a personal Digital Garden (Knowledge Base). When the user provides a brief concept or learning, Antigravity MUST automatically expand, format, categorize, and deploy this learning to the `today-i-learned` repository.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Analysis and Expansion (Silent)

- Analyze the `[concept/learning]` provided by the user.
- Expand this brief thought into a high-quality, professional engineering entry.
- Infer the appropriate technology category (e.g., `javascript`, `react`, `databases`, `architecture`, `tools`, `devops`, `web-performance`, `accessibility`).
- Generate a clear, concise title and a kebab-case filename (e.g., `nextjs-server-actions-limitations.md`).

### 2. Formatting (Silent)

Generate the markdown content strictly following the `today-i-learned` template:

````markdown
# [High-Quality Title]

**Date**: [Current YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Category**: [Category Name]

## What I Learned

[A detailed, elite-level technical explanation of the concept.]

## Example

```[language]
// Concrete code example demonstrating the concept. Generate one if the user didn't provide any.
```
````

## Why It Matters

[Architectural, performance, or development workflow impact of this learning.]

## References

- [Official documentation link or relevant technical article (autogenerated by the agent)]

```

### 3. File Creation and Repository Injection (Silent)
- Navigate to the local repository: `~/playground/repos/LuisSambrano/today-i-learned`.
- Locate or create the target category folder. MUST use `mkdir -p` if it doesn't exist.
- Write the generated markdown content into the target file `~/[...]/[category]/[filename].md` using the `write_to_file` tool.

### 4. Git Deployment (Silent)
- Change directory to the repository: `cd ~/playground/repos/LuisSambrano/today-i-learned`.
- Execute standard Git flow to deploy the new knowledge:
  - `git pull origin main` (To ensure we are up to dates)
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "docs(til): add entry about [topic/concept]"`
  - `git push origin main`

### 5. Final User Notification (Interactive)
- Notify the user **in Spanish** that the learning has been successfully processed and pushed to the remote repository.
- Provide a summary of the generated file (Title, Category, Filepath).
- Ask the user if they'd like to adjust anything or provide the next task.
